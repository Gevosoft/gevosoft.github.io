We are soon updating the [Bullet Journal Companion](https://bulletjournal.ml) to version 16.1 and this includes an exciting new feature! In older versions of the Bullet Journal Companion (before 16.0) we had a backup feature which allowed the user to push and pull logs between devices. The new Sync feature extends this functionality to not only sync whenever the app is opened and/or closed it also sync all data (except page images).

### How to get started

All you have to do to enable this feature is navigate to *settings*, tap on the *Sync* button and then select *sign up*, then when you want to get your data on another device simply do the same thing but instead of selecting *sign up* you select on *sign in*. That's how easy it is!

### Your data is safe

Don't worry your login data and app data is safe, we use Firebase which is a Google product and we do not ourselves store your login info.

### How to get your old backed up logs

If you had your data backed up using the old feature you can request that we send your logs by sending us an email (contact.gevosoft@gmail.com)
